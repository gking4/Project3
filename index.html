          To pass Project 3, a student must make proper use of HTML,
          CSS, and Javascript. They will put together all the things
          learned in CINS-110. With these things put together
          the student will make a website and host it on github.
          Under the HTML section, a student needs to have at least
          two pages and cohesive design as well as an image. Under the
          CSS section a student must use both selectors and classes 
          as well as use it for the design aspects of the webpage,
          rather than using inline style. The Javascript is worth the 
          most points and has the most requirements. Students must
          use variables, operators, conditions and functions. They 
          must also gather input from the user and change the website
          with that input. They will also need to make use of 
          cookies to store information and make use of javascript
          events. They additionaly will need to use either arrays,
          iterationm or JSON objects.
